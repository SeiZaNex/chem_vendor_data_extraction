This is a readme file for the chem_vendor_script

UNIX: The script works by just running itself. ( Give executing permissions on your system. "$> chmod +x" )

It will read EVERY link in the [url_list.txt] file. These links have been handpicked and checked their response beforehand.

The script will generate an output format of the technical info on each web page into the [brc_output.txt]

WARNING: The script is a running loop, you might be waiting for roughly 1-2 hours (depending on the CPU) until the script is done.
